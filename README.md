# DownUnder Workshoppe (Learn Underscore)

Welcome to the DownUnder Workshoppe!

This workshop is to give you small exercises to get familiar with underscore.js on nodejs.  Underscore.js is a utility library which contains a collection of functions that can really help transform data.

This workshoppe will walk you through the underscore api and give you simple examples of each of the functions, it is designed so you may skip around and only practice what you want.

## Background

Underscore.js was created by Jeremy Askansas the creator of Backbone.js and other great opensource libraries.  Underscore is a collection of functions that make it a pleasure to work with arrays, functions and keep your code clean and readable.

## Situation

Downunder is created to help javascript students to practice using the underscore functions without having to build full applications and hopefully get a solid idea of their powerful functionality.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have NodeJS and NPM installed see [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org), then npm install downunder and run downunder in a console and your ready to go.  

```
npm install downunder -g
downunder
```

Follow the adventures...

Have Fun!

## Recommendations

I recommend creating a play directory and then naming each program by exercise: 1.js 2.js etc...
